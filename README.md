### To do ###
* Optimize code, using grid system
* Implement predators

### Goals ###
* General Layout: Create 2D application that simulates boids. Include functionality that allows us to change settings regarding boid behavior (e.g., velocity, flocking, etc). If time allows, predators.
* Also if time allows, user interactivity -- controlling flocking behavior? Controlling predators?

### How to install SFML
* [SFML Library](http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) - Visualizing the project. When installing SFML Library, choose C++11

### How to clone this repository while using Visual Studio ###
* Open up Visual Studio
* "Open from Source Control"
* Input the cloning link from Bitbucket repo
* Visual Studio might prompt you to install Git GUI. Do so. Once that's done, you should see the solution "Boids" on the left side. Double click it and you should be good to go.
To commit saved changes to the bitbucket repo, open up Git GUI and open up the Boids folder. From there you commit. Then when you want to push up to the Bitbucket repo, you click push.

### To do ###
* [SFML Library](http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) - Visualizing the project
* General Layout: Create 2D application that simulates boids. Include functionality that allows us to change settings regarding boid behavior (e.g., velocity, flocking, etc). If time allows, predators.
* Also if time allows, user interactivity -- controlling flocking behavior? Controlling predators?
